# Visualizing Event Studies

Here you'll find a visualization tool designed for researchers interested in analyzing event studies. This tool allows users to define their estimands, impose their assumptions, and select valid samples for analysis within their datasets. Additionally, the platform includes a suite of weighting diagnostics, describing covariate balance, the implied weighted populations, group-wise ESS, information contributions of observation groups, and influence of individual observations on the estimator. This visualization tool aims to enhance the transparency of event study analyses and empower researchers to make well-informed decisions in their analysis.

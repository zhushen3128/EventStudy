Visualizing Event Studies
================

Here youâ€™ll find a visualization tool designed for researchers
interested in analyzing event studies. This tool allows users to define
their estimands, impose their assumptions, and select valid observations
for analysis in their datasets. Additionally, the platform includes a
suite of weighting diagnostics, describing the implied weighted
populations, group-wise effective sample size (ESS), information
contributions of observation groups, and influence of individual
observations on the estimator. This visualization tool aims to enhance
the transparency of event study analyses and empower researchers to make
well-informed decisions in their analysis.

## Introduction

This platform is an interactive visualization tool for researchers
working on event studies. It enables users to:

- For a given dataset of event studies with staggered intervention,
  implement the classical dynamic TWFE regression estimator and a
  proposed robust weighting estimator developed in our recent
  [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17399).

- Perform diagnostics to visualize and understand the implied target
  population, analyze effective sample size (ESS) and information
  borrowing.

The platform leverages `R` and `Shiny` to offer real-time interaction,
allowing users to dynamically adjust parameters and observe results.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: \[List types of graphs or data
  visualizations.\]
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust inputs dynamically to observe
  changes in outputs.
- **Real-Time Data Analysis**: Upload datasets and generate immediate
  insights.
- **Downloadable Results**: Export visualizations or reports in various
  formats.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple navigation for seamless operation.
